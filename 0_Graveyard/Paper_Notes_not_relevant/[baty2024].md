## Abstract
> With the rise of e-commerce and increasing customer requirements, logistics service providers face a new complexity in their daily planning, mainly due to efficiently handling same day deliveries. Existing multi-stage stochastic optimization approaches that allow to solve the underlying dynamic vehicle routing problem are either computationally too expensive for an application in online settings, or – in the case of reinforcement learning – struggle to perform well on high-dimensional combinatorial problems. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose a novel machine learning pipeline that incorporates a combinatorial optimization layer. We apply this general pipeline to a dynamic vehicle routing problem with dispatching waves, which was recently promoted in the EURO Meets NeurIPS Vehicle Routing Competition at NeurIPS 2022. Our methodology ranked first in this competition, outperforming all other approaches in solving the proposed dynamic vehicle routing problem. With this work, we provide a comprehensive numerical study that further highlights the efficacy and benefits of the proposed pipeline beyond the results achieved in the competition, e.g., by showcasing the robustness of the encoded policy against unseen instances and scenarios.

## Summary

- **Problem & Context**  
  - Addresses a *dynamic VRP with time windows (VRPTW)*, in which new requests arrive over time, and dispatching decisions must be made online.  
  - Motivated by same-day delivery challenges in e-commerce, where orders appear continuously and fast reactions are required.

- **Core Methodological Contribution**  
  - Proposes a *machine learning pipeline* enriched with a *combinatorial optimization (CO) layer*.  
  - This pipeline handles dynamic and uncertain arrival of requests by learning to predict “prize” vectors for a *prize-collecting VRPTW*.  
  - An *ML module* produces request-specific parameters (prizes), which are then fed into a *metaheuristic (Hybrid Genetic Search)* that determines actual vehicle dispatching and routing.  
  - The approach extends existing CO-enriched ML frameworks by allowing a *non-linear objective* (prize minus route cost) and embedding a *metaheuristic* (as opposed to an exact solver) in the backpropagation loop.  

- **Learning Framework**  
  - Utilizes a *supervised learning* (imitation) approach, where the model learns from an “anticipative strategy” that sees the entire horizon offline.  
  - The pipeline backpropagates a *Fenchel-Young style loss*, approximating gradients from the heuristic solution.  
  - Because exact gradients are unattainable for a large combinatorial problem, the model uses *smoothed or approximate gradient estimates* from repeated heuristic calls.

- **Metaheuristic and Implementation Details**  
  - The CO layer is a specialized *Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS)* adapted for prize-collecting VRPTW.  
    - Extends prior VRPTW-focused HGS frameworks with new operators to remove or insert optional requests.  
    - Includes “mutation” operators that randomly alter the set of served requests, balancing exploration and exploitation.  
    - Employs warm-start capabilities when used in training to reduce solution variance and speed up convergence.  
  - They show that this pipeline (ML-layer + heuristics) converges in training despite the metaheuristic-based objective.

- **Experimental Results**  
  - Conducted on the *EURO Meets NeurIPS Vehicle Routing Competition* dynamic VRPTW problem.  
  - The proposed pipeline achieved *first place*, outperforming classical rolling-horizon and Monte Carlo–driven approaches.  
  - Notable outcome: *Imitating an offline anticipative solver* produced good policies for the online dynamic scenario, even though the offline solver sees requests that are unknown in a real setting.  

- **Key Insights & Observations**  
  - Integrating ML into a *combinatorial layer* can effectively capture future uncertainties without the overhead of solving large stochastic programs.  
  - Contradicting some literature, *simple supervised imitation of an anticipative strategy* performed strongly in a high-dimensional dynamic environment.  
  - The approach is *generalizable* beyond VRP; the authors highlight potential in broader multi-stage optimization tasks with dynamic data.

- **Strengths & Limitations**  
  - **Strengths**:  
    - Innovative bridging of *machine learning, combinatorial optimization*, and metaheuristics for dynamic dispatching.  
    - Demonstrates robust performance in uncertain, high-dimensional test cases.  
    - The pipeline is open-sourced and flexible, supporting different VRP variants.
  - **Limitations**:  
    - Relies on large computational resources during the offline training phase.  
    - Assumes knowledge of the request distribution.  
    - Addresses dynamic VRP rather than purely deterministic VRPs, hence not directly suitable for static/deterministic setups.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP**  
  - Primarily tackles *dynamic* (online) VRPTW with time windows and uncertain order arrivals.  
  - Out of scope for pure *deterministic VRP* research.  
  - Showcases advanced ML-heuristics synergy, but the main problem domain is *dynamic routing*, hence it does not match a fully deterministic problem environment.
