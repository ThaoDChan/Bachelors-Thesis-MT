## 1.1 Context and Motivation

In the contemporary landscape of global commerce, supply chain management has become increasingly intricate due to factors such as heightened international competition, the exponential growth of e-commerce, and the pressing demand for sustainable operations. Transportation expenses constitute a substantial portion of logistics costs, significantly influenced by challenges like last-mile delivery complexities and the dynamic nature of customer demands. Efficiently optimizing routing decisions is paramount for companies striving to maintain a competitive edge in this environment.​

At the heart of these optimization efforts lies the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a combinatorial optimization challenge that focuses on determining the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to service a set of customers. The objective is to minimize overall operational costs while adhering to constraints such as vehicle capacities and delivery time windows.First introduced by Dantzig and Ramser [dantzig1959] in 1959, the VRP has since evolved into a cornerstone problem in logistics and operational research. Its significance is underscored by its direct impact on reducing distribution costs and enhancing service quality. ​

The complexity of the VRP is well-documented: [Lenstra1981] established that the VRP is NP-hard, indicating that the problem's computational difficulty escalates exponentially with the increase in the number of customers and constraints. This exponential growth in complexity renders exact solution methods impractical for large-scale instances, necessitating the exploration of alternative approaches.

Traditional solution techniques for the VRP include exact algorithms, heuristics, and metaheuristics. Exact algorithms, such as branch and bound or branch and cut, guarantee optimal solutions but are computationally infeasible for large instances due to their exponential time complexity. Heuristic methods, like the Clarke-Wright savings algorithm, offer quicker, albeit approximate, solutions by simplifying the problem's complexity. Metaheuristic approaches, including Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search, provide more flexible frameworks capable of escaping local optima and exploring a broader solution space. However, these methods often require extensive parameter tuning and may still struggle with the scalability and dynamic nature of real-world VRPs [braysy2005a], [braysy2005b].

In response to these challenges, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) techniques into VRP solutions has garnered significant attention. ML approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks, have demonstrated potential in capturing the complex relationships inherent in VRP scenarios, enabling more effective and adaptive routing strategies. Reinforcement Learning methods offer the capability to learn and adapt to dynamic environments, making them particularly suited for VRPs with real-time constraints and uncertainties. Hybrid models that combine ML techniques with traditional heuristics aim to leverage the strengths of both approaches, enhancing solution quality and scalability. ​

## 1.2 Problem Statement and Approach

This thesis focuses on the deterministic VRP which assumes that all problem parameters, such as customer demands and travel times, are known and constant, providing a stable foundation for exploring solution methodologies.​

The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive literature review of ML-based approaches applied to the VRP. This involves analyzing and classifying various ML models and evaluating their performance. A total of <font color="#ff0000">XXX</font> scholarly papers across different VRP and ML domains have been  examined to ensure a thorough and representative analysis.​

Key areas of focus include:
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comparing the effectiveness of ML-based methods against traditional optimization techniques in terms of solution quality, computational efficiency, and scalability.​
- **Common Challenges**: Identifying prevalent obstacles in applying ML to VRPs, such as data requirements, model interpretability, and integration with existing systems.​
- **Future Directions**: Exploring potential avenues for further research, particularly the development of hybrid models that synergize ML algorithms with heuristic methods to tackle large-scale VRP instances more effectively.​
    
By systematically reviewing and synthesizing existing research, this thesis aims to provide valuable insights into the current state of ML applications in VRP, highlighting both the achievements and the areas necessitating further investigation. The findings are intended to serve as a foundation for future studies aiming to enhance VRP solutions through the integration of machine learning techniques.​
