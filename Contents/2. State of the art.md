##  2.1 Vehicle Routing Problems

###  2.1.1 The Conventional Vehicle Routing Problem

The most fundamental and well-studied routing problem is without doubt the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) , in which a salesman is to visit a set of cities and return to the city he started in. The objective for the TSP is to minimize the total distance traveled by the salesman.

The CVRP is first described by Dantzig and Ramser (1959) as follows: 

The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a generalization of the TSP in that the VRP consists in determining m vehicle routes, where a route is a tour that begins at the depot, visits a subset of the customers in a given order and returns to the depot. All customers must be visited exactly once and the total customer demand of a route must not exceed the vehicle capacity. The objective of the VRP is to minimize the overall distribution costs. In most real-life distribution contexts a number of side constraints complicate the model.

A number of identical vehicles with a given capacity are located at a central depot. They are available for servicing a set of customer orders, (all deliveries, or, alternatively, all pickups). Each customer order has a specific location and size. Travel costs between all locations are given. The goal is to design a least cost set of routes for the vehicles in such a way that all customers are visited once and vehicle capacities are adhered to.

Laporte et al. (1985) proposed a mixed integer linear programming formulation for the CVRP, where the integer variable xe indicates the number of times that edge e ∈ A is traversed in the solution. Let δ(S) = {(i, j) : i ∈ S, j /∈ S or i /∈ S, j ∈ S} for S ⊆ N . Let v(S) denote the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve the node set S, which can be obtained by solving the Bin Packing Problem (BPP) with S and bins of capacity q. The formulation is as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\mathrm{CVRP1}) \quad 
& \min \sum_{e \in A} c_e \, x_e \tag{2.1}\\[6pt]
\text{s.t.}\quad
& \sum_{e \in \delta(\{i\})} x_e = 2 
    && \forall i \in \mathcal{C}, \tag{2.2}\\
& \sum_{e \in \delta(\{0\})} x_e = 2m, \tag{2.3}\\
& \sum_{e \in \delta(S)} x_e \ge 2\,v(S) 
    && \forall S \subseteq \mathcal{N},\, S \neq \emptyset, \tag{2.4}\\
& x_e \in \{0,1\}  
    && \forall e \notin \delta(\{0\}), \tag{2.5}\\
& x_e \in \{0,1,2\} 
    && \forall e \in \delta(\{0\}). \tag{2.6}
\end{aligned}
$$

The degree constraints (2.2) and (2.3) make sure that each customer is visited exactly once and m routes are created. Constraints (2.4) impose both the connectivity of the solution and vehicle capacity requirement by forcing a sufficient number of edges to enter each subset of nodes. Constraints (2.5) ensure that each edge between two customers is traversed at most once. Constraints (2.6) state that each edge between the depot and customer can be traversed at most twice. If a vehicle performs a single-customer route, the edge between the depot and the customer will be traversed twice.

Another useful formulation of the CVRP is the set partitioning formulation, in which all the feasible routes are enumerated and their costs are determined in advance (Bramel and Simchilevi (2002)). The objective is to find a set of routes that form a feasible solution with minimum total cost. Let R denote the set of all feasible routes, each of which has a load less than or equal to the vehicle capacity. The cost of each route r ∈ R is denoted by cr. Note that cr is the minimum cost of serving the customers covered by r. Parameter ari states
whether customer i is covered by route r. Binary variable zr equals 1 if route r is selected and 0 otherwise. The CVRP is then formulated as follows:

###  Other VRP Variants

Static Vehicle Routing Problem. 1. All information relevant to the planning of the routes is assumed to be known by the planner before the routing process begins. 2. Information relevant to the routing does not change after the routes have been constructed.

Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem. 1. Not all information relevant to the planning of the routes is known by the planner when the routing process begins. 2. Information can change after the initial routes have been constructed.
