## Abstract
"With the rapid advancement of drone technology, the efficient distribution of drones has garnered significant attention. Central to this discourse is the energy consumption of drones, a critical metric for assessing energy-efficient distribution strategies. Accordingly, this study delves into the energy consumption factors affecting drone distribution. A primary challenge in drone distribution lies in devising optimal, energy-efficient routes for drones. However, traditional routing algorithms, predominantly heuristic-based, exhibit certain limitations. These algorithms often rely on heuristic rules and expert knowledge, which can constrain their ability to escape local optima. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates a drone energy consumption model, namely EMADRL. The EMADRL algorithm first formulates the drone routing problem within a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. It subsequently designs a strategy network model comprising multiple agent networks, tailored to address the node adjacency and masking complexities typical of multi-depot vehicle routing problem. Training utilizes strategy gradient algorithms and attention mechanisms. Furthermore, local and sampling search strategies are introduced to enhance solution quality. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that EMADRL consistently achieves high-quality solutions swiftly. A comparative analysis against contemporary algorithms reveals EMADRL’s superior energy efficiency, with average energy savings of 5.96% and maximum savings reaching 12.45%. Thus, this approach offers a promising new avenue for optimizing energy consumption in last-mile distribution scenarios."

## Summary
- **Context & Motivation**  
  - Drones are increasingly important for last-mile logistics, but they face energy constraints due to limited battery capacity and payload weight.  
  - Traditional drone routing algorithms (genetic algorithms, ant colony, etc.) often rely on heuristic groupings, risk local optima, and do not fully exploit learning-based approaches.  
  - The authors aim to reduce drone energy usage in multi-depot routing scenarios by using a deep reinforcement learning approach that jointly accounts for routing decisions and real-time payload changes.

- **Problem & Contributions**  
  1. **Drone Energy Model**  
     - Proposes a linearized drone energy consumption model that depends on the drone’s payload and overall weight, approximating flight energy in sub-routes.  
  2. **Multi-Agent DRL Formulation**  
     - Treats each depot–drone pair as an agent in a shared environment.  
     - Employs a policy-gradient-based DRL approach (REINFORCE with baseline) to decide sequential routing actions that minimize energy consumption.  
  3. **Neural Network Architecture (EMADRL)**  
     - Encoder–decoder with attention to handle node features and compute next-action probabilities.  
     - Integrates node masking (to handle capacity feasibility) and adjacency.  
  4. **Local Search Enhancements**  
     - Incorporates 2-opt to fix route crossings locally.  
     - Sampling-based search approach to counter overconfidence in a purely greedy policy.  

- **Methodology**  
  - **State Space**: Each agent tracks its current route, remaining capacity, and visited customers. A global state encodes all unvisited nodes.  
  - **Action Space**: Each agent selects the next node (unvisited customer or return to depot) subject to capacity constraints.  
  - **Reward**: Defined as the negative total travel distance (and thus energy consumption) for the entire multi-depot solution.  
  - **Training**  
    - Uses a mini-batch approach with policy gradient updates.  
    - Reference network (baseline) helps reduce gradient variance.  
    - Trains on randomly generated instances of different sizes (30–100 nodes) to promote generalization.  

- **Results & Findings**  
  - Compared against DDPG and an improved variant (DDPG-D3QN).  
  - EMADRL demonstrates higher solution quality (reduced route distance) and lower energy consumption.  
  - On small- to medium-scale tasks, it achieves 3–12% savings in energy relative to baselines.  
  - Integrating sampling and local 2-opt search significantly boosts solution quality, avoiding greedy selection pitfalls.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP**  
  - The problem is framed as a multi-depot VRP with deterministic demands and no time windows.  
  - The method can be generalized to other deterministic VRP variants if an appropriate cost model is incorporated.  
  - Demonstrates how learned policies can outperform classical methods (e.g., partial local search heuristics) by capturing complex interactions across multiple depots.

- **Strengths & Limitations**  
  - **Strengths**:
    - Original multi-agent viewpoint for multi-depot distribution.  
    - Explicit drone energy model integrated into the RL pipeline.  
    - Local search operators enhance solution refinement.  
  - **Limitations**:
    - The maximum instance size is 100 nodes, which might not reflect large-scale real-world deployments.  
    - Performance comparison relies on randomly generated data rather than standard VRP benchmarks, limiting direct comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.  

- **Potential Impact & Future Work**  
  - Highlights the effectiveness of integrating domain-specific models (energy constraints) within DRL for deterministic logistics.  
  - Encourages further exploration of multi-agent RL in multi-objective VRPs (e.g., balancing cost and environmental impact).  
  - Suggests that including more realistic constraints (e.g., time windows, real flight conditions) could be next steps for extended research.
