## Abstract
The green vehicle routing problem (GVRP) is a trendy variant of the well-known vehicle routing problem that incorporates environmental considerations such as minimized fuel consumption or emissions. This study introduces a new hybrid approach combining variable neighborhood search (VNS) with the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to effectively resolve the GVRP. VNS is a metaheuristic optimization technique that explores numerous neighborhoods of a solution to improve it, whereas RL is an agent-based machine learning algorithm. Thus, integrated with VNS, the RL may find competitive solutions for the GVRP. Our numerical results and analysis prove the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid methodology for resolving the GVRP. This new hybrid strategy benefits from the combination of VNS as an evolutionary optimizer and RL as a machine learning methodology to effectively resolve the GVRP.

## Summary
- **Context and Motivation**
  - The paper deals with a **Green Vehicle Routing Problem (GVRP)**, focusing on reducing emissions, fuel usage, and travel distance.  
  - It responds to ongoing efforts to make vehicle routing more environmentally friendly, acknowledging growing interest from companies and government agencies in minimizing the carbon footprint of logistics operations.  

- **Objective**
  - Proposes a **hybrid method** combining **Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to solve the GVRP more effectively.  
  - Seeks to handle multiple objectives: delivering maximum cargo, reducing total traveled distance, and lowering emissions/fuel consumption.  

- **VNS Component**
  - VNS is introduced as a **metaheuristic local search** strategy.  
  - It systematically changes neighborhood structures (e.g., 2-opt, 3-opt, cross-exchange) to refine solutions and avoid local optima.  
  - The paper outlines how VNS can quickly generate high-quality initial solutions that can be improved further.  

- **RL Component**
  - The RL approach views GVRP as a **sequential decision-making** process, where an agent refines the solution based on rewards (e.g., shorter distances, fewer emissions).  
  - The state space includes current route layouts, unvisited customers, vehicle capacities, and distance matrices.  
  - Actions correspond to neighborhood operators or route modifications (e.g., swapping customers between routes).  
  - The RL learns how to apply these actions adaptively to enhance performance over time.  

- **Hybrid RL-VNS Approach**
  - **Workflow**: 
    1. VNS generates a competitive initial solution.  
    2. RL refines and further improves the solution by sampling and exploring various route modifications.  
    3. RL’s feedback mechanism guides which neighborhood expansions or local search operations are most beneficial at each iteration.  
  - This hybrid combines the **strengths of a well-structured neighborhood search** with the **adaptive nature of RL**, aiming to converge faster and more effectively than using either method alone.  

- **Experimental Setup**
  - Tested on **Solomon’s benchmark instances** (R101, R103, R105, R107, R109, R111), each with 100 customers and time window constraints.  
  - Comparison with three baselines:  
    - **Tabu Search (TS)**  
    - **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**  
    - **Standalone VNS**  
  - Execution time, distance traveled, and number of required vehicles are used as performance measures.  

- **Key Findings**
  - **Distance Reduction**: RL-VNS yields the shortest routes, outperforming TS, GA, and standalone VNS on most instances.  
  - **Fewer Vehicles**: RL-VNS typically uses fewer vehicles to serve customers while respecting time and capacity constraints, demonstrating better resource utilization.  
  - **Moderate Computation Time**: While RL-VNS requires slightly more CPU time (minutes difference), the gains in solution quality (reduced distance, fewer vehicles) are significant.  
  - **Stability**: RL-VNS shows a robust convergence pattern, consistently improving solutions over iterations, avoiding early stagnation.  

- **Strengths and Contributions**
  - **Novel Combination**: Integrates RL with a rigorous VNS-based local search, expanding the body of hybrid ML-heuristics for VRP.  
  - **Scalability**: The method can handle 100-customer instances reasonably well, demonstrating potential applicability to larger deterministic VRP sets.  
  - **Multi-Objective Handling**: Balances cost, capacity, and environmental objectives explicitly, making it relevant for “green” logistics scenarios.  

- **Limitations and Future Directions**
  - **Computational Overhead**: Increased time due to the RL loop, though it remains manageable for medium-sized benchmarks.  
  - **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The authors note that RL parameters (learning rate, exploration rate) and VNS search parameters must be tuned carefully.  
  - **Real-World Data**: Future research might incorporate additional constraints (e.g., real-time road networks or dynamic events), although this paper focuses on deterministic GVRP.  
  - **Integration with Other Methods**: Potential synergy with advanced metaheuristics (e.g., ALNS, Tabu Search) or deeper neural models (e.g., policy networks, GNNs) for further performance improvements.  

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP Research**
  - The study addresses a **deterministic** setting without stochastic components, making it directly relevant for a review of ML-based VRP methods.  
  - It highlights that a well-structured synergy between RL and a proven local search strategy can yield high-quality solutions for green routing challenges, which fits neatly into the domain of **machine learning approaches** for **deterministic** VRP.
