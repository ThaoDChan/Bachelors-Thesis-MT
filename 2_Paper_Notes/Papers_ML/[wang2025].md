## Abstract
“The vehicle routing problem with backhauls (VRPBs) is a challenging problem commonly studied in computer science and operations research. Featured by linehaul (or delivery) and backhaul (or pickup) customers, the VRPB has broad applications in real-world logistics. In this article, we propose a neural heuristic based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve the traditional and improved VRPB variants, with an encoder-decoder structured policy network trained to sequentially construct the routes for vehicles. Specifically, we first describe the VRPB based on a graph and cast the solution construction as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, to identify the relationship among the nodes (i.e., linehaul and backhaul customers, and the depot), we design a two-stage attention-based encoder, including a self-attention and a heterogeneous attention for each stage, which could yield more informative representations of the nodes so as to deliver high-quality solutions. The evaluation on the two VRPB variants reveals that, our neural heuristic performs favorably against both the conventional and neural heuristic baselines on randomly generated instances and benchmark instances. Moreover, the trained policy network exhibits a desirable capability of generalization to various problem sizes and distributions.”

## Summary
- **Core Focus**:  
  - Proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to solve two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB): the traditional VRPB (delivery strictly before pickup in each route) and the improved VRPB (relaxed sequence constraints).
  - Introduces a specialized encoder-decoder policy network leveraging a two-stage attention mechanism.

- **VRP Variant**:  
  - VRPB, specifically focusing on deterministic, static conditions where linehaul (delivery) and backhaul (pickup) customers must be routed.
  - Compares a “traditional” variant (strict precedence of delivery over pickup in each route) to an “improved” variant (allows delivery and pickup in any sequence so long as capacity is respected).

- **Method & ML Techniques**:
  1. **DRL/Policy Gradient**:  
     - Casts route construction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).  
     - Uses the REINFORCE algorithm to optimize parameters.
  2. **Encoder-Decoder Model**:  
     - Encoder has a **two-stage attention**: a self-attention that processes all nodes jointly, followed by a *heterogeneous attention* that specifically learns correlations between linehaul and backhaul nodes.  
     - Decoder employs a masking scheme that ensures feasibility under capacity and ordering constraints (if any).  
     - The entire network is trained end-to-end to minimize route length.
  3. **Multiple Tracks for Improved Exploration**:  
     - Simultaneously considers multiple “start nodes” (linehaul nodes) to generate diverse solutions and improve training stability.

- **Key Results**:
  - Outperforms or competes favorably with both conventional solvers (CPLEX, LKH-3, GA, ALNS) and existing neural baselines (Attention Model AM, POMO, FER) on randomly generated VRPB instances of sizes up to 150 or 300 nodes.
  - Achieves high-quality solutions in short inference time (sub-second for medium instances) and favorable generalization to unseen problem sizes and node distributions.
  - Demonstrates competitive or near-optimal performance on benchmark datasets (derived from CVRPLib or older VRPB sets).
  
- **Strengths**:
  - **Novel Two-Stage Attention**: Specifically designed for heterogeneous node types, leading to stronger embeddings.  
  - **Generalization**: Model shows robust performance on larger and differently distributed instances without retraining.  
  - **Computational Efficiency**: Achieves sub-second runtimes on instances up to 150 nodes, thanks to parallel GPU computations.

- **Limitations**:
  - Focuses solely on deterministic demand; no discussion of dynamic or stochastic aspects.  
  - Still subject to the typical neural approach tradeoff: partial interpretability and potential suboptimal performance for extremely large instances (e.g., &gt;1000 nodes).  
  - Requires specialized attention-based architecture, potentially more complex than simpler pointer network models.

- **Relevance to Deterministic VRP Research**:
  - Fits directly within the thesis scope: uses DRL for deterministic VRP.  
  - Demonstrates a new architecture and thoroughly compares it with classical and modern (neural) baselines.  
  - Provides insights on encoding different customer types in a single framework and the effect of a two-stage attention on solution quality.

- **Conclusion & Outlook**:
  - Neural heuristic approach with a Transformer-style encoder proves viable for routing problems featuring backhauls.  
  - Future work may reduce computational overhead on extremely large-scale instances, handle additional constraints (e.g., heterogeneous fleets), and explore advanced exploration strategies in DRL.
