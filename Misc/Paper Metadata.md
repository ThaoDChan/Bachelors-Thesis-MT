# Type of ML Algo

  - Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially:
     * Policy gradients (REINFORCE)
     * Q-learning (some use DQN)
     
   - Transformermodels (attention-based, pointer networks)
   - Graph-based networks (GCN, GNN embeddings)
   - Supervised Learning:
     * heuristic operators (insertion, local search)
     * parameter tuning (like hyper-heuristics)
   - Large Neighborhood Search guided by neural nets
     (destroy & repair operators learned via RL)
   - Evolutionary/Metaheuristics (GA, PSO, NSGA-II, etc.)
     combined with ML for operator selection or parameter adaptation
   - Clustering-based heuristics using machine learning
     (like k-means, DBSCAN, or specialized cluster algorithms)
   - Hybrid approaches:
     * RL + local search (2-opt, swap, insertion)
     * Learned value functions + MIP/column generation
     * Data-driven heuristics to refine or select columns/paths
