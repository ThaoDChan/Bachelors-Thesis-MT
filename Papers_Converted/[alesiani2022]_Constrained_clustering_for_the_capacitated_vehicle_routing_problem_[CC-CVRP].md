## ABSTRACT

## ARTICLE HISTORY

eCommerce,  postal  and  logistics'  planners  require  to  solve large-scale  capacitated  vehicle  routing  problems  (CVRPs)  on a daily basis. CVRP problems are NP-Hard and cannot be easily solved for large problem instances. Given their complexity, we propose  a  methodology  to  reduce  the  size  of  CVRP  problems that  can  be  later  solved  with  state-of-the-art  optimization  solvers. Our method is an efficient version of clustering that considers the constraints of the original problem to transform it into a  more  tractable  version.  We  call  this  approach  Constrained Clustering Capacitated Vehicle Routing Solver (CC-CVRS) because  it  produces  a  soft-clustered  vehicle  routing  problem with  reduced  decision  variables.  We  demonstrate  how  this method  reduces  the  computational  complexity  associated with the solution of the original CVRP and how the computed solution  can  be  transformed  back  into  the  original  space. Extensive numerical experiments show that our method allows to solve very large CVRP instances within seconds with optimality  gaps  of  less  than  16%.  Therefore,  our  method  has  the following  benefits:  it  can  compute  improved  solutions  with small  optimality  gaps  in  near  real-time,  and  it  can  be  used  as a warm-up solver to compute an improved solution that can be used as an initial solution guess by an exact solver.

## Introduction

The  Vehicle  Routing  Problem  (VRP)  is  a  generalization  of  the  traveling salesman problem (TSP) which considers multiple vehicles. As its generalization,  it  can  use  several  exact  optimization  approaches  that  have  been developed for the TSP (Christofides, Mingozzi, and Toth 1981a). The VRP is  one  of  the  most  well-studied  combinatorial  optimization  problems  due to  its  practical  relevance  (Golden,  Raghavan,  and  Wasil  2008;  Laporte 2009;  Toth  and  Vigo  2014).  The  VRP  determines  the  optimal  routes  of a  set  of  vehicles,  based  at  one  or  more  depots,  in  order  to  serve  a  set  of customers  (see  Toth  and  Vigo  (2002)).  This  study  is  concerned  with  the Capacitated  Vehicle  Routing  Problem  (CVRP).  The  CVRP  is  NP-Hard

since  it  contains  the  NP-Hard  Traveling  Salesman  and  Bin  Packing  problems  as  special  cases  (Faiz,  Krichen,  and  Inoubli  2014).  According  to Dantzig  and  Ramser  (1959),  the  CVRP  is  defined  as  follows:  find  a  set  of minimum  cost  vehicle  routes  starting  and  ending  at  the  depot  such  that each customer is visited only by one vehicle and the capacities of vehicles are  not  exceeded.  The  fleet  of  vehicles  is  identical  and  has  a  known capacity.  The  travel  cost  between  any  pair  of  customers  is  known  and  it can be either symmetric (e.g., the same in both directions) or asymmetric.

In its basic definition, the solution of the CVRP is a set of tours, one for each vehicle, comprised of an ordered set of customers. The CVRP has been studied since  the  early  1960s  and  the  most  effective  exact  formulations  can  solve problems with up to 100 customers (see Gadegaard and Lysgaard (2021) and the  survey  of  Laporte  and  Nobert  (1987)).  Effective  exact  methods  for  the solution  of  CVRP  are  branch  and  bound  with  relaxations  (e.g.,  use  of  the shortest  spanning tree  and shortest  path  relaxations  Christofides,  Mingozzi, and Toth (1981a)) and branch and cut methods originally used for the solution of  the  TSP  (see  Naddef  and  Rinaldi  (2002);  Baldacci,  Christofides,  and Mingozzi (2008); Pecin et al. (2017)). Other exact approaches include dynamic programming Eilon et al. (1974),Christofides (1985) and integer linear programming Fisher and Jaikumar (1978) (e.g., two-index and three-index vehicle flow formulations).

CVRP  appears  in  many  applications,  ranging  from  scheduling  the deliveries of logistic companies (Wang, Shao, and Zhou 2017) to deliveries with  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  (Song,  Park,  and  Kim  2018). Except  from  delivery  problems,  CVRP  also  appears  in  pickup  problems (Tasan  and  Gen  2012).  Several  public  transport  services  that  operate  ondemand need to assign  vehicles  to  passengers  by  solving  CVRPs.  Because of  its  broad  applications  and  its  NP-Hardness  that  does  not  allow  the computation of globally optimal solutions for large-scale problem instances,  CVRP  has  received  significant  research  attention.  Recently,  the need  of  rescheduling  the  routes  of  vehicles  to  adapt  to  the  passenger demand  changes  in  near  real-time  has  increased  the  need  to  obtain CVRP  solutions  within  a  short  time,  even  if  these  solutions  are  not  the globally  optimal  ones  (Petrakis,  Hass,  and  Bichler  2012).  Especially  the availability  of  real-time  information  about  the  changes  in  passenger demand  might  require  to  repeatedly  solve  CVRP  problems  in  order  to reassign  vehicles  to  routes.  In  such  cases,  exact  solvers  cannot  provide a  solution  within  a  reasonable  time  and  generic  heuristics  may  fail  if  the problem  instances  are  large.

This  study  contributes  in  this  direction  by  proposing  an  approach  to compute improved solutions to large-scale CVRP problem instances within seconds. This can be beneficial to vehicle scheduling companies that need to assign their vehicles to routes within a short time. In addition, the proposed

![Image](image_000006_ec6585baea3de1bff89fbad3835ce12119b8289350da137704e1dd7ebdea8741.png)

approach can be used to compute a solution to large-scale CVRP problems within seconds in order to offer an initial solution guess that speeds up the search of a globally optimal solution from exact CVRP solvers.

In this study, we explicitly focus on large-scale CVRP instances that appear in a broad spectrum of practical applications ranging from logistics to communication networks and agriculture. In contrast to common heuristics, we propose  the  use  of  constrained  clustering  for  large-scale  CVRP  problems. More specifically,  we  propose  a  clustering  method  that  is  loosely  related  to k-means  and  it  aims  at  partitioning  our  customers  into k clusters  that  are treated  as  compressed  nodes.  This  allows  the  partitioning  of  the  data  space into Voronoi cells and enables the combination of compressed clusters to find a  diverse  set  of  improved  tours  within  a  limited  computational  time.  By developing such clusters we solve a much smaller soft-clustered CVRP considering the locations of the cluster heads, also called cluster centroids, instead of solving a CVRP considering all customer locations (see Hintsch and Irnich (2020) for more details about the soft-clustered CVRP).

The remainder of our study is structured as follows. In section 2, we present related studies on solving large-scale CVRPs with a particular focus on clustering methods. In addition, we elaborate further on the contribution of our work in light  of  the  relevant  literature.  Section  3  introduces  our  method  of constrained  clustering  that  clusters  customers.  In  section  4  we  present  our numerical  experiments.  Finally,  section  5  provides  the  concluding  remarks and discusses further directions of research.

## Related Studies

In this section, we elaborate on the characteristics of the large-scale CVRP and we  report  heuristic  and  clustering  methods  that  are  commonly  used  for solving  such  problems.  Qu  et  al.  (2004)  defines  a  CVRP  instance  of  100  to 1000 nodes as large-scale . Huang and Xiangpei (2012) provide an overview of existing literature on solving large-scale CVRP problems and classify the main solution  methods  previously  used  in  this  area  as  tabu  search,  evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing and local search.

Large instances of the CVRP are typically solved with the use of heuristics. The large body of literature on  heuristic  solution  methods  for  the  CVRP  is partially covered by the surveys of Christofides, Mingozzi, and Toth (1981a); Christofides  (1985);  Magnanti  (1981);  Bodin  (1983);  Fisher  (1995);  Laporte (1992); Konstantakopoulos, Gayialis, and Kechagias (2020). Heuristics include the nearest neighbor algorithm, insertion algorithms, and tour improvement procedures. The classic Clarke &amp; Wright algorithm (Clarke and Wright 1964), the sweep algorithm described by Wren and Holliday (1972); Gillett and Miller (1974) and the Christofides-Mingozzi-Toth two-phase algorithm (Christofides,  Mingozzi,  and  Toth  1981b)  are  well-known  heuristics  for  the

CVRP. Tabu search Gendreau, Hertz, and Laporte (1994); Zhu et al. (2012), ant colony Mazzeo and Loiseau (2004); Lee et al. (2010), genetic algorithms Dorronsoro  et  al.  (2007);  Nazif  and  Lee  (2012),  and  simulated  annealing Tavakkoli-Moghaddam,  Safaei,  and  Gholipour  (2006);  Leung  et  al.  (2010) have also been extensively used in past literature. In a recent survey of Mor and Grazia Speranza (2020) covering the studies on periodic routing problems Zhang et al. (2017); Archetti, Fernandez, and Huerta-MuÃ±oz (2017); Archetti, Jabali, and Grazia Speranza (2015); Campbell and Wilson (2014); Gulczynski, Golden,  and  Wasil  (2011);  Campbell  and  Hardin  (2005),  inventory  routing problems  Archetti,  Christiansen,  and  Grazia  Speranza  (2018);  Archetti  and Grazia Speranza (2016); Coelho, Cordeau, and Laporte (2014); Archetti et al. (2014);  Bertazzi,  Savelsbergh,  and  Grazia  Speranza  (2008);  Archetti  et  al. (2007);  Savelsbergh  and  Song  (2007);  Lau,  Liu,  and  Ono  (2002),  multi-trip VRPs  and  split  deliveries  Archetti  and  Grazia  Speranza  (2013);  Archetti, Savelsbergh,  and  Grazia  Speranza  (2006),  variable  neighborhood  search, memetic  algorithms,  simulated  annealing  and  genetic  algorithms  were reported  as  employed  solution  approaches  in  several  studies.  Braekers, Ramaekers, and Van Nieuwenhuyse (2016) refer to Gendreau et al. (2008b) for a categorized bibliography on metaheuristic approaches for different VRP variants.

An initial attempt to solve large CVRP instances was made by Gendreau, Hertz, and Laporte (1994) for problems with instance sizes of up to 199 nodes using tabu search to restrict the route length. The simulated annealing metaheuristic was later shown to provide an efficient solution for up to 300 nodes (Tavakkoli-Moghaddam,  Safaei,  and  Gholipour  2006).  While  the  simulated annealing algorithm employs an efficient Trie tree data structure to accelerate the  search,  it  solves  CVRP  with  two-dimensional  loading  constraints  for instances with up to 255 nodes (Leung et al. 2010). With three-dimensional loading constraints, an efficient tabu search algorithm can also be equivalently efficient  (Zhu  et  al.  2012).  A  parallel  cellular  genetic  algorithm,  PEGA Dorronsoro  et  al.  (2007),  was  used  to  solve  large  CVRP  instances  of  up  to 1200 nodes (Li, Golden, and Wasil 2005). The ant colony heuristic Lee et al. (2010) is also proposed to solve large-scale benchmark instances of Toth and Vigo (2003).

Syrichas and Crispin (2017) solved the VRP with 1200 nodes by quantum annealing.  Huang  and  Xiangpei  (2012)  used  a  knowledge  representation  of qualitative  factors,  such  as  experts'  distribution  experience,  drivers'  preferences, customer features, traffic information, and geographical features on the benchmark instances of Li, Golden, and Wasil (2007) with 200 to 480 nodes.

In  addition  to  large-scale  problems,  past  works  have  focused  on  'super' large-scale problems.  Arnold,  Gendreau,  and  Kenneth  (2019a)  solved instances of the CVRP with up to 30000 nodes with a local search heuristic combining  pruning  and  sequential  search.  Bujel  et  al.  (2019)  proposed

![Image](image_000007_e5624ea2f81e295c3cba479fcd1a662fc52c063f8ddbef656026970678f7d916.png)

a  clustering  algorithm  that  outperforms  the  Google  OR-tool  in  solving  the capacitated  VRP  with  time  windows  by  performing  well  on  graph  sizes  of 2000-5000 nodes. Finally, Tu et al. (2017) presented a novel spatial parallel heuristic approach that uses spatial partitioning strategies (vertical rectangle, horizontal rectangle, grid,  fan,  KD tree,  and  cluster)  to  divide  a  region  into a set of small cells that allow using parallel local search. Tu et al. (2017) tested this on large-scale and super large-scale instances with 20000 nodes, using the shared memory library OpenMP as parallel computing platform.

Past studies that use clustering when solving the CVRP typically employ the k-means clustering method. In k-means clustering, customers are grouped into k clusters. Each customer belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean and the resulting  centroids  are  derived  from  the  geo-locations.  Mostafa  and  Eltawil (2017) used k-means clustering to assign customers to a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles before solving the TSP for each vehicle using mixed integer programming (MIP) with valid inequalities  that  aim  to  accelerate  its  computational time. This method is capable of solving a problem size of 100 customers with a  5%  optimality  gap.  Similarly,  Singanamala,  Reddy,  and  Venkataramaiah (2018)  used  k-means  clustering  as  the  first  stage  of  a first  assign  then  route approach in solving the multi-depot VRP. This solution technique, known as Cluster-First Route-Second Method (CFRS), first divides customers into clusters, and  then  solves  an  independent  TSP  on  each  cluster  (Shalaby, Mohammed, and Kassem 2021).

The aforementioned clustering studies for the CVRP problem typically use a vicinity-based assignment of clusters to vehicles that stuck in local optima. The use of k-means clustering in our work differs from those studies because we treat the clusters as compressed nodes and solve a high-level CVRP. Our study's contribution allows combining compressed clusters to find a diverse set of tours, rather than performing a vicinity-based assignment of clusters to vehicles  that  stuck  in  a  local  optimum.  Our  study  transforms  the  original CVRP problem into a high-level CVRP. We thus reduce the problem's complexity and we show in simulation that we reduce significantly the computation times without getting trapped in local optima. After using our approach to cluster the CVRP, the CVRP can be modeled as a clustered CVRP (see Defryn and  Kenneth  (2017);  Hintsch  and  Irnich  (2020))  and  it  can  be  solved  with existing solution methods.

## Solving CVRP Using Constrained Clustering

## Overview of Our CC-CVRP Approach

The CVRP belongs to the category of NP-hard problems that can be exactly solved only for small problem instances (Gendreau et al. 2008a). Therefore, we concentrate on developing clustering-based heuristic algorithms to solve

this  problem  in  large-scale  instances.  Our  Constrained  Clustering  for  the CVRP (CC-CVRP) is loosely related to k-means (Forgy 1965; Lloyd 1982). We use a constrained clustering approach where customers are grouped into clusters (Hintsch and Irnich 2020). Each generated cluster will be served by only one vehicle and contains at least one customer .  The resulting clustered CVRP has the following characteristics:

- (1) A vehicle can serve more than one cluster;
- (2) A cluster should have at least one customer;
- (3) Each customer belongs to one, and only one, cluster;
- (4) Clusters are determined in such way that all customers in the cluster can be served by a single vehicle.

To provide an overview of the approach, we present an example with five customers in Figure 1. A potential outcome of our CC-CVRP approach is the determination of three clusters with at least one customer each, where each cluster is served by a single vehicle.

Note  that  one  vehicle  can  serve  multiple  clusters  and  the  sequence  of customers served by a vehicle is determined in a subsequent stage by solving a  Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for each vehicle. The final outcome of our CC-CVRP approach is presented in Figure 2 where we solve the respective TSP problem for each vehicle.

To summarize, our CC-CVRP approach comprises the following steps: Step 1: solve the CVRP problem to find a set of optimal cost routes for a  fleet  of  capacitated  vehicles  considering  the cluster  heads as  representatives  of  all  customers  in  each  cluster  (outcome  of  Figure  1);

Step  2:  for  each  vehicle  visiting  one  or  more  clusters  replace  the  cluster heads with the customer locations and solve a TSP to determine the optimal order of serving the customers (outcome of Figure 2).

Figure 1. CC-CVRP example (step 1): two vehicles starting from a warehouse serve five customers assigned to three clusters.

Figure 2. CC-CVRP example (step 2): the minimum cost routes of the vehicles assigned to clusters are determined by solving seperate TSPs.

We note that the key aspect of our CC-CVRP approach is the determination of the clusters presented in Figure 1. This will be explained in detail in the next section. Focusing on solving the clustered CVRP problem when the clusters are  already  provided,  we  determine  first  the  set  of  served  clusters  by  each vehicle  and  then  the  optimal  order  of  visiting  its  customers.  Clustering  of customers is used to reduce the number of variables when solving the NP-Hard CVRP. The cluster heads are similar to virtual customers in the new problem definition,  where  the  demand  of  the  virtual  customer  is  the  sum  of  the demands of the customers that belong to the cluster.

Whereas  the  second  step  is  straightforward  and  there  exist  numerous algorithms  for  solving  the  TSP  problem,  the  problem  expressed  in  step  1 needs to be modeled in a different way than the traditional CVRP formulation that considers the actual customers instead of cluster heads. In particular,  the  locations  of  customers  are  now  replaced  by  the  locations  of  the heads  of  the  clusters  that  represent  our  virtual  customers.  For  ease  of reference, the nomenclature introduced in our proposed CC-CVRP model is presented in Table 1.

Herein, we define the distance between two clusters ck and cl as the distance between their cluster head locations dkl Â¼ d ck Ã° ; cl Ã (see Alg.3 for the determination of the cluster head locations). We thus neglect the inter-distance of the customers inside the clusters in step 1. If we define binary variable ykl which is equal to 1 if traveling from the k -th to the  -th cluster is part of the solution, we l can cast the clustered CVRP using the formulation in Equations (1)-(9).

Note that in Equations (1)-(9) we find the set of minimum cost routes to serve  a  set  of clusters .  That  is,  in  Equations  (1)-(9)  actual  customers  are replaced by virtual customers (cluster heads).

$$\begin{matrix} \dots \dots & \dots \dots & \dots \dots & \dots \\ & \min _ { y _ { k l } } \sum _ { k \in K } \sum _ { l \in K } d _ { k l } y _ { k l } & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & \end{matrix}$$

Equation  (1) searches for the minimum total cost routes to serve all clusters. The indegree and outdegree constraints of Equations (2)-(3) ensure that vertices are visited exactly once. That is, exactly one arc enters and leaves each vertex  associated  with  a  cluster.  Constraint  (4)  ensures  that  the  number  of vehicles  leaving  the  depot  is  the  same  as  the  number  of  returning  vehicles. Considering the subtour elimination constraints proposed by Miller, Tucker, and Zemlin (1960), Equations (5)-(6) impose the capacity requirements of the CVRP. In more detail, when ykl Â¼ 0 constraint (5) becomes Î¸l Ã¾ Q ï¿½ Î¸k which holds true for any Î¸l ; Î¸k 2 Â½ 0 ; Q ï¿½ . Thus, for ykl Â¼ 0 constraint (5) is not binding.

In reverse, when ykl Â¼ 1 constraint (5) imposes that Î¸l ï¿½ Î¸k Ã¾ ql . Equation (6) ensures that the vehicle load after leaving cluster k : (i) is greater than or equal to the aggregate demand that is picked up when visiting cluster k , (ii) and does not  exceed  the  vehicle  capacity Q .  Constraints  (7)  are  the  integrality  constraints. Lastly, constraint (8) ensures that we will not use more vehicles than available.

The clustered  CVRP problem in Equations (1)-(9) returns the minimum cost  routes  to  serve  all  clusters.  However,  this  solution  does  not  return  the minimum  cost  routes  to  serve  the  actual  customers.  Because  of  this,  we proceed  to  step  2  where  we  solve  a  TSP  for  each  vehicle  by  replacing  the locations  of  the  cluster  heads  with  the  locations  of  the  actual  customers inside  the  clusters.  Solving  a  TSP  for  each  vehicle  returns  the  shortest possible route that visits  all  the  customers  assigned  to  that  vehicle  (namely, all  customers  inside  its  visited  clusters).  It  is  important  to  note  that  when serving  the  TSP  for  each  vehicle  in  step  2  we  consider  only  the  customers that  must  be  served  by  a  vehicle  according  to  the  outcome  of  step  1.  The order of serving these customers is determined by the TSP and the clusters do  not  play  a  role  in  step  2,  except  from  predetermining  which  customers should  be  served  by  each  vehicle.

## Determining the Clusters and the Cluster Heads

To solve the clustered CVRP in Equations (1)-(9), we need to define first the clusters and their respective cluster heads. This is achieved by implementing our clustering algorithm that is implemented in two phases: 1) the assignment phase and 2) the update phase. Alg.3 describes the algorithmic steps following the nomenclature in Table 1. The cluster heads are defined by their positions, ck , where k Â¼ 1 ; . . . ; j K j , and j K j is the number of clusters (a given parameter). Note that j K j might change from iteration to iteration if we have customers that  cannot  be  assigned  to  clusters  or  if  we  have  empty  clusters  without customers.  For  this  reason,  our  clustering  algorithm  is  loosely  based  on k-means since it is self-adaptive.

The  cluster  heads  can  be  seen  as  centroids  that  represent  a  number  of customers. Alg.3 starts with j K j random cluster heads. One way to define the cluster heads is to randomly select j K j clusters. The algorithm then proceeds with assigning the actual customer positions to the closest cluster head, only if this does not violate the constraints of Equations (1)-(9). Clearly, 0 &lt; j K j ï¿½ V ï¿½ n ,  where V is  the  total  number of available vehicles, and n is the number of customers.

Let ck be the location of the cluster head of cluster k 2 K . Let also ak be the set of customers associated with that cluster. That is, ak Â¼ f j i i 2 k g , where i 2 f 1 ; . . . ; n g is an actual customer. Let also Ak be the set of customer locations associated  with  that  cluster.  Each  customer i 2 f 1 ; . . . ; n g has  a  customer

![Image](image_000012_eaf936e18ec81fab80edea2676f0a5e8dc5438fd387515518017e5e0c102a8dc.png)

location ui ; hence, Ak Â¼ f ui j i 2 k g . In  addition, a Â¼ S k ak is  the  set  of assigned customers, while U Â¼ U 0 n a is  the  set  of  unassigned  customers and U 0 Â¼ f 1 ; . . . ; n g are all customers. Similarly, C Â¼ f c 1 ; . . . ; c j K j g is the set of the cluster head locations.

Initially,  the  cluster  head  location  of  each  cluster k is  randomly  selected from  the  set  of  customer  locations Ã° u 1 ; . . . ; un Ã .  That  is, ck , UÃ° u 1 ; . . . ; un Ã , such  that ck ï¿½ cj ; â j 2 K .  We  initially  assume  that  all  clusters  are  empty: ak Â¼ ; ; â k 2 K .  Using  the  randomly  selected  locations  of  the  cluster  heads, ck ; â k 2 K we perform the following steps:

Step 1 :  We order the customers i 2 Ã° 1 ; . . . ; n Ã based on their distances to the cluster heads. This ensures that we will cluster customers by prioritizing the ones that are closer to cluster heads. When adding a specific customer to his/her closest cluster head is not possible because of capacity limitations, we know that all previously assigned customers are closer to that cluster than the current  customer.  Figure  3  shows  the  effect  of  assigning  a  customer  to  an adjacent  cluster  when  the  capacity  of  the  current  cluster  is  reached.  The distance of any customer i 2 Ã° 1 ; . . . ; n Ã to his/her closest cluster head k 2 K is

$$D _ { i } = \min _ { k } d _ { i, k }$$

where di k ; is  the  distance between the location of customer i and the cluster head ck .  After  computing  the  distances  of  customers  to  their  closest  cluster heads, D 1 ; D 2 ; . . . ; Dn , we  map  customers Ã° 1 2 ; ; . . . ; n Ã to Ã° b 1 ; b 2 ; . . . ; bn Ã which belong to a priority queue P Â¼ Ã° b 1 ; b 2 ; . . . ; bn Ã such that Db 1 ï¿½ Db 2 ï¿½ . . . ï¿½ Dbn .  This step is performed by the algorithmic routine in Alg.1.

Algorithm 1 Step 1 - algorithmic routine that returns the ordered list of customers, P

Figure 3. CC-CVRP example (step 1): Customers are ordered by distance. In this way, customers that are assigned to another cluster are the most distant ones from the centroid.

- k 4: set P Â¼ Ã° b 1 ; . . . ; bn Ã such that Db 1 ï¿½ . . . ï¿½ Dbn
- 5: output : P Â¼ Ã° b 1 ; . . . ; bn Ã

Step 2 : In this step we assign customers to clusters. Starting from customer b 1 in the priority queue we perform the following:

We first  initialize  the  set Cb 1 Â¼ K of  the  potential  clusters  where  we  can assign customer b 1 and we determine the closest cluster k ï¿½ to customer b 1 :

$$k ^ { * } = \arg \min _ { k } d _ { b _ { 1 }, k }$$

Then, we check if:

- Â· cluster k ï¿½ has not reached its maximum allowed number of customers, W ,
- Â·  the  distance db 1 ; k ï¿½ is  smaller  than  or  equal  to  the  maximum  allowed distance between a customer and a cluster head, R , P
- Â· and the accumulated customer demand in this cluster, Î¼ b 1 Ã¾ j 2 ï¿½ a k Î¼ j , where P j 2 ï¿½ a k Î¼ j is the aggregate demand of all customers that are already in cluster k ï¿½ , is

less than or equal to the vehicle capacity Q .

If all the above hold true, we add customer b 1 to the set of customers a ï¿½ k of cluster k ï¿½ .  If  not,  customer b 1 is  not  assigned  to  cluster k ï¿½ and  we  remove cluster k ï¿½ from the set of the potential clusters for customer b 1 : Cb 1 Cb 1 nf k ï¿½ g .  Then,  we  perform  the  same  checks  for  the  remaining clusters in set Cb 1 until, hopefully, customer b 1 is assigned to a cluster.

If customer b 1 is assigned to a cluster k , we update the cluster head location of that cluster to represent the centroid (geometric center) of all customers in the cluster. The cluster head location for the extended set ak is calculated as

$$c _ { k } = \frac { 1 } { | a _ { k } | } \sum _ { i \in a _ { k } } u _ { i }$$

where j ak j is the number of all customers in cluster k that are stored in set ak . This step terminates once we process all customers in the priority queue (see Alg.2).

If our  algorithm  has  converged  and  not  all  customers  are  assigned  to  the K clusters  or  there  are  clusters  from  the  set K with  no  customers,  we incrementally  increase  or  reduce,  respectively,  the  number  of  clusters j K j and  we  perform  again  all  the  steps  of  our  clustering  algorithm.  This  selfadaptation  part  of  our  clustering  algorithm  guarantees  the  assignment  of all  customers  to  clusters  (Alg.3).

Note that the assignment step of customers to clusters, the update step of the  locations  of  the  cluster  heads,  and  the  termination  criterion  are  loosely based on the k-means algorithm. One main difference is that in our assignment step we do not always assign the customer to the closest cluster head because we require to satisfy also a number of distance and capacity-related constraints. In addition, our number of clusters j K j can change if our algorithm fails to assign all customers to clusters.

## Implementation Steps

To  summarize,  in  Figure  4  we  present  the  implementation  steps  of  our constrained clustering approach for the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CC-CVRP).

Initially,  we  use  information  regarding  the  network  topology,  the  distances among  customers  and  the  number  of  available  vehicles  to  implement  the Constrained Clustering Algorithm (Alg.3). By doing so, we assign all our customers to clusters. Using the cluster head locations and the overall demand in each cluster, we solve the clustered CVRP presented in Equations (1)-(9) by using an external CVRP solver (i.e., one might use branch-and-cut or a heuristic solver). In this step we assign vehicles to clusters that include one or more customers. Finally, for each vehicle that needs to serve a number of customers from the clusters we solve a TSP to determine the optimal route of serving these customers.

## Computational Complexity

Using the big O notation, the complexity of the original CVRP problem that considers actual customers instead of cluster heads is exponential. In particular, it is O Ã° 2 n 2 Ã (Toth and Vigo 2002).

Solving  a  clustered  CVRP  reduces  the  number  of  decision  variables  by a factor of r Â¼ n = j K j , hence the complexity of the clustered CVRP is reduced to O Ã° 2 Ã° n r = Ã 2 Ã .  Once  the  clustering  problem  is  solved,  we  still  have  to  solve singular  TSP  problems  for  every  vehicle  that  is  assigned  to  one  or  more clusters.  The  complexity  of  each  TSP  problem  depends  on  the  number  of customers  visited  by  the  respective  vehicle.  When  using  the  well-known Held-Karp  algorithm,  the  worst-case  complexity  of  the  TSP  is O m Ã° 2 2 m Ã , where m is the number of visited customers. If we have V assigned vehicles, the  number  of  customers  served  by  each  vehicle  is m ï¿½ n V = ,  and  the complexity  of  this  step  is O Ã°Ã° n V = Ã 2 2 Ã° n V = Ã Ã .  Because  we  need  to  solve  the TSP for all vehicles V , the worst-case complexity of our CC-CVRP approach is O Ã°Ã° n 2 = V Ã 2 Ã° n V = Ã Ã¾ O Ã° 2 n 2 = r 2 Ã . If j K j &lt; n , the  computational  complexity O Ã° 2 n 2 = r 2 Ã dominates complexity O Ã°Ã° n 2 = V Ã 2 Ã° n V = Ã in  large  problem  instances resulting in a worst-case complexity of O Ã° 2 n 2 = r 2 Ã .

To summarize, by solving a clustered CVRP instead of the original CVRP we reduce the worst-case time complexity from O Ã° 2 n 2 Ã to O Ã° 2 n 2 = r 2 Ã . In the extreme case that the number of clusters is equal to the number of customers, j K j Â¼ n , then r Â¼ 1 and the complexity of the proposed approach becomes O Ã°Ã° n 2 = V Ã 2 Ã° n V = Ã Ã¾ O Ã° 2 n 2 Ã .  As  expected,  the  proposed  approach  does  not  offer a  benefit  in  terms  of  computational complexity in the extreme case where one

assigns  a  cluster  to  each  customer.  If,  however,  we  assign  several  customers  to a  cluster  our  method  results  in  a  time  complexity  reduction  from O Ã° 2 n 2 Ã to O Ã° 2 n 2 = r 2 Ã .

## Numerical Experiments

## Assessment Framework and Benchmark Datasets

Our  CC-CVRP maps  the  original  CVPR  problem  into  a  reduced  dimension problem (see Alg.3). While the time complexity gain when using the proposed approach  is  exponential,  the  searched  solution  space  is  reduced,  potentially excluding the optimal solution. We evaluate both the computational costs and the  optimality  gaps  using  a  large  number  of  publicly  available  problem instances  designed  for  benchmarking solution approaches for the CVRP. We evaluate the quality gap, defined as the relative performance difference between:

- (a) the solution of our CC-CVRP approach,
- (b) and the proven optimal or best known solution reported in http://vrp. galgos.inf.puc-rio.br for the respective problem instances.

We note that to solve the clustered CVRP problem in Equations (1)-(9) we need to use branch-and-cut to compute a globally optimal solution or a  heuristic  to  compute  an  approximate  solution.  In  addition,  we  need  to solve  subsequent  TSP  problems  for  each  single  vehicle  and  this  might result  in  higher  computation  costs  in  some  problem  instances,  as  discussed  in  our  previous  section.  This  is  investigated  in  our  numerical experiments where we test the computation costs and the solution quality of  the  proposed  approach.

In our implementation, the TSP problems are solved using the tspy Python package  that  implements  the TwoOpt local  search  algorithm.  All  tests  are conducted  in  a  general-purpose  computer  with  a  2.3  GHz  Intel  Core  5 processor and a 16GB RAM. Our test instances include the following instances that are publicly available at http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br:

- Â· Small-scale instances A with 32 to 82 customers.
- Â· Medium-scale instances X with 101 to 350 customers.
- Â· Large-scale instances X with 350 to 1001 customers.
- Â· Very large-scale instances with 3000 to 16000 customers.

## Small-scale Instances

As  previously  mentioned,  globally  optimal  solutions  for  the  NP-Hard CVRP  problem  can  be  computed  only  in  small-scale  instances.  For this,  we  initially  use  as  benchmark  small  problem  instances  that  belong

![Image](image_000017_b9f25ed8a08532556cb9948043f6876b5d90000e64dc4386cf6b910c3c316eb5.png)

to  class  A  described  in  Uchoa  et  al.  (2017).  These  test  instances  and  their globally  optimal  solutions  are  publicly  available  at  http://vrp.galgos.inf. puc-rio.br.

In  this  initial  investigation,  we  report  the  performance  when  solving  our CC-CVPR and the original CVRP when imposing a time limit of 100 seconds. Then,  we  compare  the  solution  of  our  CC-CVPR  and  the  solution  of  the original  CVRP  against  the  globally  optimal  solution  available  at  http://vrp. galgos.inf.puc-rio.br. Our objective is twofold: first, to investigate the optimality  gap  of  our  CC-CVRP  solution  with  respect  to  the  globally  optimal solution;  second,  to  investigate  the  performance  improvement  of  our  CCCVRP solution compared to the solution of the original CVRP problem when using a time limit of 100 seconds for both methods. The latter will show us whether  clustering  can  lead  to  better  solutions  by  allowing  to  explore  the solution space more efficiently.

As  discussed,  to  ensure  an  unbiased  comparison  we  use  the  same computation  budget  of  100  seconds  when  solving  the  CC-CVRP  and  the original CVRP. The results from all small-scale problem instances in class A  are  reported  in  Table  2  where  we  present  the  optimality  gap(s)  when solving  the  CC-CVRP and the original CVRP with respect to the globally optimal  solution.  In  more  detail,  column  1  presents  the  identification number of the problem instance that belongs to the A class. Each instance is coded  as  A-nXX-kY  where  XX  refers  to  the  number  of  customers including the depot, and Y to the number of vehicles. Column 2 presents the  tightness  of  the  instance,  which  is  the  equal  to  the  total  demand divided  by  the  vehicle  capacity.  Column  3  presents  the  dispersion  of  the instance, which is the standard deviation of the histogram of the distances over  the  mean.  Column  4  presents  the  best-known  solution  reported  in http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br  and  column  5  states  whether  this  solution is  a  proven  optimal.  We  note  that  all  solutions  of  the  instances  of  class A  reported  in  column  4  are  globally  optimal.  Column  6  presents  the performance of the CC-CVRP solution and column 7 presents the optimality  gap  of  this  solution  with  respect  to  the  globally  optimal  solution presented in column 4. Finally, columns 8 and 9 present the performance and  the  optimality  gap  of  the  solution  when  solving  the  original  CVRP problem without considering clusters.  Note  that  the  CC-CVRP  and  original  CVRP  solutions  are  the  best  found  solutions  within  100  seconds.

From  Table  2  one  can  note  that  the  CC-CVRP  solutions  have  an average  optimality  gap  of  10.1%  with  a  standard  deviation  of  4.8%  when compared  against  the  respective  globally  optimal  solutions.  In  contrast, the  average  optimality  gap  of  the  solutions  of  the  original  CVRP  problem is  11.4%  (1.3%  higher).  This  demonstrates  that  the  proposed  approach used more efficiently the 100-second computation budget to find improved  solutions.

We  further  compare  the  results  of  our  approach  against  the  results  of Shalaby,  Mohammed,  and  Kassem  (2021)  who  developed  a  Cluster-First Route-Second Method (CFRS) approach where customers are first divided into  clusters,  and  then  each  cluster  is  solved  independently  as  a  TSP. Shalaby,  Mohammed,  and  Kassem  (2021)  used  a  Fuzzy  C-Means  (FCM) clustering  technique  to  assign  customers  into  clusters.  In  their  work,  they present  results  for  instances  A-n32-k5,  A-n33-k6,  A-n36-k5,  A-n33-k5, and  A-n39-k6  after  running  their  algorithm  for  up  to  15  minutes.  Their results are presented in the 4th column of Table 3. When comparing their results  against  the  results  of  CC-CVRP,  the  CC-CVRP  solution  performs better  in  instances  A-n32-k5,  A-n36-k5  and  A-n33-k5,  whereas  the  FCM solution  performs  better  in  instances  A-n33-k6  and  A-n39-k6.  We  should note,  however,  that  the  FCM  has  a  computation  budget  of  15  minutes, whereas  the  proposed  CC-CVRP  approach  has  a  computation  budget  of only  100  seconds.

In  the  following  sections  of  our  numerical  experiments  we  present  the performances  of  the  CC-CVRP  solutions  and  their  optimality  gaps  with respect to best-known solutions for medium-scale, large-scale, and very largescale  problem  instances.  Note  that  we  do  not  provide  results  regarding  the

solutions  of  the  original  CVRP  for  these  larger  instances  because  it  is  not possible to find such solutions within 100 seconds due to the computational complexity of the original CVRP.

## Medium-scale Instances

In  the  medium-scale  instances  we  present  the  results  when  solving  our CC-CVRP within  100  seconds  for  the  X  instances  with  up  to  350  customers  (see  Table  4).  The  best-known  solutions  of  these  instances  are publicly  available  at  http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br  and  in  column  5  we declare  which  ones  of  them  are  globally  optimal  and  which  are  just  bestknown.  On  average,  the  optimality  gap  of  our  CC-CVRP  solutions  is  9% with  a  standard  deviation  of  4.4%.

## Large-scale Instances

In the large-scale instances we present the results when solving our CC-CVRP within 100 seconds for the X instances with customers ranging from 350 to 1001 (see Table 5). The best-known solutions of these instances are publicly available at http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br and in column 5 we declare which ones of them are globally optimal and which are just best-known. On average, the optimality gap of our CC-CVRP solutions is 8.7% with a standard deviation of 4%.

## Very Large-scale Instances

In  the  very  large-scale  instances  we  present  the  results  when  solving  our  CCCVRP within 100 seconds for the instances of Arnold, Gendreau, and Kenneth (2019a)  with  customers  ranging  from  3000  to  16000  (see  Table  6).  The  bestknown solutions of these instances are publicly available at http://vrp.galgos.inf. puc-rio.br. On average, the optimality gap of our CC-CVRP solutions is 15.7% with a standard deviation of 5.3%.

a CVRP considering the cluster heads. At its first stage, the proposed approach assigns  vehicles  to  clusters.  This  is  achieved  by  introducing  a  self-adapting clustering algorithm that is loosely based on k-means. At its second stage, we determine  the  tour  of  each  vehicle  by  solving  a  TSP  considering  the  set  of customers that belong to the assigned clusters of that vehicle.

Our proposed CC-CVRP approach is applied in a large number of benchmark scenarios described in  Uchoa et al. (2017)  and  available  at  http://vrp. galgos.inf.puc-rio.br  considering  three  different  solvers.  Our  experiments demonstrate that our CC-CVRP approach returns solutions that outperform the  solutions  of  solving  the  unclustered  CVRP  in  small-sized  problem instances by 1.3% in terms of solution quality. For larger problem instances, it  is  not  even  possible  to  compute  solutions  when  solving  the  unclustered (original)  CVRP  within  a  computational  budget  of  100  seconds.  Our  CCCVRP approach, however, was capable of finding improved solutions even for very  large  problem  instances  with  up  to  16000  customers.  In  particular,  it exhibited:

- Â· an average optimality gap of 10.1% and a standard deviation of 4.8% in small-sized instances;
- Â·  an  average  optimality  gap  of  9%  and  a  standard  deviation  of  4.4%  in medium-sized instances;
- Â· an average optimality gap of 8.9% and a standard deviation of 4% in largesized instances;
- Â· an average optimality gap of 15.7% and a standard deviation of 5.3% in very large-sized instances.

In  future  research,  one  can  expand  further  our  method  to  apply  it  in different  types  of  VRP,  such  as  the  Vehicle  Routing  Problem  with  Time Windows (VRPTW) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits (VRPP). The proposed approach can also be extended by considering the development of multiple clusters with the use of different hyper-parameters (e.g., number of customers  per  cluster)  and  selecting  the  best  setting.  In  addition,  learningbased  methods,  such  as  neural  network  clustering,  can  be  used  to  offer adaptive clustering by learning the characteristics of specific types of problem instances.
